\begin{frame}{Origins of Molecular Dynamics (MD)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Modern MD was developed in the 1950s, influenced by Monte Carlo methods popularized at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
        \pause
        \bigskip
        \item However, interest in the evolution of N-body systems dates back to the 17th century with Isaac Newton, focusing mainly on celestial mechanics.
        \pause
        \bigskip
        \item Many key numerical algorithms were created before computers. For example, the \textbf{Verlet integration algorithm}, the most common today, was used as early as 1791 by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre.
    \end{itemize}

    Before digital computers, modeling was done in other ways:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Analog computers} were used to integrate the equations of motion.
        \pause
        \item Some scientists built \textbf{physical models} with spheres to replicate the structure of liquids and study their behavior.

\begin{frame}{From Classical to Quantum MD}
    Let's recall the key step in the MD algorithm:
    \pause
    \begin{center}
        \large \textbf{Calculate the Forces}
    \end{center}
    \pause
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In classical MD, forces come from \textbf{predefined potentials} (force fields) like the Lennard-Jones potential.
        \pause
        \bigskip
        \item These potentials are efficient, but they \textbf{cannot describe} quantum phenomena like the formation or breaking of chemical bonds, or reactions.
        \pause
        \bigskip
        \item The natural question was: Can we calculate the forces directly from quantum mechanics \textbf{"on the fly"} at each step of the simulation?
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
    
    \begin{alertblock}<6->{The Birth of Quantum Molecular Dynamics}
        This idea gives rise to \textbf{Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD)}, where forces are obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation for the electrons at each atomic configuration.
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{The Breakthrough: The Car-Parrinello Method (1985)}
    The field of AIMD was revolutionized by a paper from \textbf{Roberto Car and Michele Parrinello}.
    \pause
    
    \begin{block}{The Car-Parrinello Innovation (CPMD)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Instead of fully solving for the electronic state at each step (which is very expensive), they introduced a \textbf{fictitious dynamics} for the electronic orbitals.
            \pause
            \item This unified the evolution of the nuclei (classical) and the electrons (quantum) into a \textbf{single Lagrangian dynamical system}.
            \pause
            \item It allowed for much longer and more efficient simulations than previous methods, opening the door to the study of complex systems in chemistry and materials science.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \pause
    
    \begin{exampleblock}<4->{Impact}
        The Car-Parrinello method turned quantum molecular dynamics into a practical and predictive tool, and it remains one of the pillars of the field today.

\begin{frame}{Two Main Approaches in AIMD}
    From these developments, two main families of Quantum Molecular Dynamics emerged:

        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \begin{block}{Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BOMD)}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Strictly adheres to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
                    \item \textbf{Calculates the electronic ground state} accurately at each time step.
                    \item It is conceptually simpler and very robust.
                    \item It generally allows for larger time steps, but each step is more computationally expensive.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{block}
        \end{column}
        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \begin{block}{Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD)}
                 \begin{itemize}
                    \item Propagates the nuclei and electronic orbitals simultaneously.
                    \item The electrons are \textbf{not exactly in the ground state} at each step, but they remain close to it.
                    \item It is computationally more efficient per time step.
                    \item It requires smaller time steps to maintain adiabaticity.
                \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The Classical Limitation and the Quantum Leap}
    Classical potentials like Lennard-Jones are excellent, but they cannot describe processes where electrons are key, such as:
    \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bond formation and breaking.
        \item Chemical reactions.
        \item Electronic properties and polarization.
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \bigskip
    
    \begin{block}{The Quantum Need}
        To simulate these phenomena, forces on the atoms must be calculated from the system's electronic structure using quantum mechanics. This gives rise to \textbf{Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD)} or \textbf{Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD)}.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{The Revolution: Car-Parrinello MD (1985)}
    \begin{block}{A Historical Milestone}
        In 1985, Roberto Car and Michele Parrinello published a revolutionary paper that unified Density Functional Theory (DFT) with molecular dynamics.
    \end{block}
    \pause
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Idea:} Treat the coefficients of the electronic orbitals as dynamical variables with a "fictitious mass".
        \pause
        \item An \textbf{extended Lagrangian} is defined for both the nuclei and the electronic degrees of freedom.
        \pause
        \item This allows electrons and nuclei to evolve \textbf{simultaneously} in time, avoiding the expensive calculation of the electronic ground state at every single step.
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
    
    \begin{exampleblock}<4->{Impact}
        The Car-Parrinello (CPMD) method made QMD simulations computationally feasible for systems of hundreds of atoms, opening the door to modern computational chemistry and materials science.
    \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{The Alternative: Born-Oppenheimer MD (BOMD)}
    This approach more directly follows the chemical intuition of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
    \pause
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For a given nuclear configuration, solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation to find the \textbf{electronic ground state}.
        \pause
        \item Calculate the forces on the nuclei ($F = -\nabla E$).
        \pause
        \item Move the nuclei for a small time step using classical dynamics.
        \pause
        \item Repeat the process from step 1.
    \end{enumerate}
    \pause
    
    \begin{alertblock}<5->{Pros and Cons}
        BOMD is conceptually simpler and ensures the system remains in the electronic ground state, but it requires a costly wavefunction optimization at every step, making it generally slower than CPMD.
