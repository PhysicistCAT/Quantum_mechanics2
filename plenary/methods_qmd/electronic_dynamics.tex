        \item It is a \textbf{semiempirical} method, meaning it combines theory with experimental parameters.
        \pause
        \bigskip
        \item Its theoretical basis is the \textbf{NDDO} (Neglect of Diatomic Differential Overlap) approximation, which is more rigorous than previous methods like INDO or CNDO.

    \begin{block}{Energies and Repulsions on a Single Atom}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The terms that describe the energy of an electron in an atom ($U_{\mu\mu}$) and the repulsion between electrons on the same atom ($g_{\mu\nu}$, $h_{\mu\nu}$) are not calculated theoretically.
            \pause
            \bigskip
            \item Instead, they are derived by fitting the calculations to \textbf{experimental spectroscopic data} for the atom and its ions.
            \pause
            \bigskip
            \item This implicitly introduces an \textbf{electron correlation} effect, as the fitted values are smaller than the theoretical ones.

        It expresses the exact wavefunction $|\Psi\rangle$ by applying an exponential "cluster operator" $e^{\hat{T}}$ to the Hartree-Fock wavefunction $|\Phi\rangle$:

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{How Coupled Cluster Works}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{cluster operator} $\hat{T}$ is a sum of excitation operators ($\hat{T} = \hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2 + \dots$), where $\hat{T}_1$ creates single excitations, $\hat{T}_2$ creates double excitations, and so on.
        \pause
        \bigskip
        \item The method uses tools from \textbf{quantum field theory} (hole-particle formalism, Wick's theorem) to solve for the amplitudes of these excitations.
        \pause
        \bigskip
        \item Its key advantage over Configuration Interaction (CI) is that truncating at $\hat{T}_2$ (CCSD) still includes the most important effects of quadruple excitations, making the method very efficient and \textbf{size-extensive}.
